Epifi Screening test project

This is a project created to Validate PAN card Number on Client Side and BirthDate Validation 

Points considered:
i) Entered birthdate must be a valid date.
ii) Pan number must be validated on client.
iii) If birthdate / pan number is not valid then the next button must be disabled.
iv) On click of Next button show toast: "Details submitted successfully" and finish the activity.
v) Dismiss activity on click of "I don't have a PAN"
vi) Architecture to be followed: MVVM
vii) Language: Kotlin
viii) Use of coroutines / RxJava is a plus.
